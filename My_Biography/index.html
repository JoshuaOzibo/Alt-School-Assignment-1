    <h1>Hi,</h1>
    <p>
      My names are <b>ozibo joshua chinedu</b> and I'am an Altschool student
      currently enrolled in the Tinyuka semester batch with Altschool student
      ID: <em>ALT/SOE/023/2676.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm in Altschool to learn Frontend Engineering and also be part of a
      growing community and contribute to the community too while gaining from
      them also.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to be a part of the graduating students at the end and also to have
      learnt enough to stand a ground as a Frontend Engineer, I also hope i
      would get to build and work on various projects while still a student at
      Altschool and after graduating too.
